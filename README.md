Java Repository for my class

Along with my mobile app class at Poly, I am concurrently taking another programming course, using and learning the magical language that is called Java. The class isnt for beginners in learning the syntax and history of Java, but it is essentially a project based class that has biweekly assignments that involve interesting projects in the Java language. I will be posting not only my assignments from my Java course, but I will also be posting fun tutorials and code that will not only help me back up my growing knowledge in Java, but further emphasizes the skills and lessons im learning in class.
